	of an analytical model, and a new design procedure is presented.
	The experiments performed with a femtosecond Ti:sapphire laser demonstrate
	that this model permits an effective resonator design and offers
	reliable guidelines for the final experimental optimization. With
	a suitable resonator configuration, self-starting of the Kerr-lens
	mode-locking regime has been achieved.},

  abstract = {Self-focusing in conjunction with an intracavity aperture creates
	a power-dependent amplitude modulation in laser oscillators, which
	allows passive mode locking. A simple analytical formalism yields
	closed-form expressions for the depth of passive amplitude modulation
	introduced by either the spatial gain profile or a hard aperture
	inserted in the resonator. Design issues for this mode-locking technique
	are discussed.},
