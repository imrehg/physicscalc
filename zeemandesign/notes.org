** Write up basic simulation (Tex)
   + Dimensionless variables, their choices and conversion
   + Detuning (+/- : red/blue??)
   + Minimum length set by maximum deceleation: what is its value?
** Read
   + How to design a slower (from the above articles)
   + Read design thesis from Ketterle group
** Figure out
   + How to parametrize coil? How to do arbitrary function?
   + Velocity at given temperature, or velocity profile
   + Simulation not function of time but distance?
   + Optimize detuning?
   + How much power?
   + Most probably velocity: decelerate that?
   + Design parameters ~ 0.4
   + Off-axis design?
   + Laser detuning jitter (add extra width term?)
   + Estimate total flux
** Code
   + Multicore functionality for more efficiency, in-situ reruns
   + Compare with existing results (eg. run simulation with Bell2010 design)
   + GUI to be able to rerun instantly with changed parameters
   + Steps to improve: on axis / transverse dimension / focused beam
   + Stop simulation at the end of the slower
   + Off-axis calculation: magnetic field direction, dB/dz, need to optimize there because most particles off-axis?
