   + *Why are the atoms repelled at the exit??*
     The interaction does not go to far-detuned near the zero velocity (far: >>5Gamma)
     Different detuning actially works -283.125MHz gives a final velocity of 8m/s
     Very sensitive of detuning
     Why is in the Bell paper different? Final velocity ~40m/s. Could this be optimized by detuning?

   + Multicore functionality for more efficiency, in-situ reruns
   + Compare with existing results (eg. run simulation with Bell2010 design: Rb85)
   + GUI to be able to rerun instantly with changed parameters
   + Steps to improve: on axis / transverse dimension / focused beam
   + Stop simulation at the end of the slower
   + Off-axis calculation: magnetic field direction, dB/dz, need to optimize there because most particles off-axis?
* Notes from meeting on <2011-08-19 Fri>
  + Redo simulation of multiple layers
    + Can represent data as fixed layer number but moving barriers
    + Have to somehow calculate the right current as well
  + Greendland1985 paper:
    + get the atomic velocity distrubution and do some simulation based on that: longitudinal slowing, transverse not changed
    + can do simpler calculation, but approximating out-diffusion time or something?
    + compare optimization with previous naive method
    + Small aperture calculation, how?
  + Given a pitch, can we get the smallest current that can be used?
  + Infinite solenoid formula
