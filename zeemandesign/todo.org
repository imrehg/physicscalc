* Layered design
* Velocity distribution from paper
* Minimum pitch


* New list:
** Layered design
   + Calculate power consumption of simulated design
   + Change the maximum capture value
   + Simulate what happens with the exact field
   + calculate eta for the simulated field (especially what happens on the low velocity end)
** Continuously variable pitch
   + Calculate power consumption
   + Finish fitting to limit minimum pitch
** Both designs
   + Easy recalculation for different field profile (ie. different laser detuning and max capture velocity)


* useful
  + Copper wire resistance
